The VBA script `TickerPriceMacro` performs a comprehensive analysis of stock prices across multiple worksheets in an Excel workbook. Below is a breakdown of the steps involved:

1. **Define Variables**: Initializes variables for worksheets, the last row with data, loop counters, ranges, ticker symbols, dates, and prices.

2. **Loop Through Worksheets**: Iterates over each worksheet within the workbook to perform the analysis on each sheet.

3. **Create CONCAT Column**: In column H, a "CONCAT" column is created, combining the ticker symbol from column A and the date from column B into a single string, formatted as "mm/dd/yyyy".

4. **Copy Unique Tickers to Column J**: Copies all ticker symbols from column A to column J, then removes duplicates to leave only unique ticker symbols.

5. **Calculate Dates, Prices, and Changes**:
   - **Earliest and Latest Dates**: For each unique ticker in column J, the script calculates the earliest (open) and latest (close) dates from column B.
   - **Open and Close Prices**: Finds the opening price on the earliest date and the closing price on the latest date for each ticker, using the `INDEX` and `MATCH` functions, and records these in columns M and N.
   - **Quarterly Change and Percent Change**: Calculates the difference between the close and open prices (quarterly change) and the percent change from open to close price, placing these in columns O and P.
   - **Total Stock Volume**: Calculates the total stock volume for each ticker and places this in column Q.

6. **Apply Conditional Formatting**:
   - Applies green color formatting to positive values and red to negative values in the "Quarterly Change" column (O) and the "Percent Change" column (P).

7. **Summary Statistics**: Calculates and displays the greatest percent increase, greatest percent decrease, and greatest total volume for the tickers analyzed, along with their corresponding tickers.

8. **Hide Intermediate Columns**: Hides columns H and K through N, which are used for intermediate calculations and not needed for the final presentation.

9. **Extend Columns J, O, P, Q, S, T, U**: Auto-fits the width of columns J, O, P, Q, S, T, and U to ensure that all data is visible and neatly presented.

At the end of the script, a message box notifies the user that the "Ticker Price Macro has completed successfully for all worksheets!", indicating the completion of the analysis.
